# KSZ8851SNL-Driver

# 1. Introduction

The KSZ8851SNL is a single-chip Fast Ethernet controller consisting of a 10/100 physical layer transceiver (PHY), a MAC, and a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

This driver is simple, effective, platform-independent, and easy to use for MCUs or other embedded platforms. 

The platform-independent architecture makes the implementation process easy. It needs just SPI callback functions as an argument to the init function.
